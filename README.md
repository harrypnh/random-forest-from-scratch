# Random Forest from Scratch
Random Forest Algorithm written in Python using NumPy and Pandas. Based on the [Decision Tree project](https://github.com/huannpham/decision-tree-from-scratch).
## 1. Overview of the Implemention
The Random Forest algorithm implemented here reuses some functions from the [Decision Tree implementation](https://github.com/huannpham/decision-tree-from-scratch). Generally, it may take different bootstrap sample sizes `n`, different numbers of random features `d` (random subspace sizes), different numbers of random splits `s`, different numbers of decision trees `k`, and different decision tree maximum depths `maxdepth`.

The algorithm is not able to work with datasets containing categorical data natively, so it requires those datasets to be preprocessed such as converting ordinal data into integers. After converting all categorical string values in a dataset to integers, a user can use that dataset with the algorithm.
